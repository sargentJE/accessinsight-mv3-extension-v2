**Impact**: Cannot test with real websites in current environment.

**Workaround**:
- Mock data pipeline fully functional for development
- Real testing can be done in external environment
- All analysis tools work with real or mock data

**Status**: DOCUMENTED, not blocking

---

### 2. Manual Validation Tool Not Interactively Tested

**Limitation**: Interactive CLI tool cannot be fully tested in non-interactive environment.

**Impact**: Tool is functional but not validated through interactive use.

**Workaround**:
